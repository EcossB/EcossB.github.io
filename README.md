# 🧑‍💻 TO-DO LIST 🧑‍💻



## A nice To-Do list created with frontend tech's that let u write and delete all the task that you have

This project that i made is basically a model of a To-Do List that was built along differents technologies and examples.
This To-Do List was created to do the following things in your browser:

* Create new task (basically ur daily task).
* Delete the task that u have already completed.
* Let u cross out the task (simulating that u already completed the task).

The technologies that i used for this project are:

* HTML5 to create the body and structure of the page. 
* CSS3 to give the styles and formatting of the page.
* JS to do the "backend" part of the project and other things.
